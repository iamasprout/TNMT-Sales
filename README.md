# TNMT-Sales
## Before going deep into our visuals here are the summary:


1. Total Orders:

California had the highest Total Orders at 3,995, which was over 9 thousand percent higher than Arkansas, the state with the lowest Total Orders at 41. Texas and Illinois followed California with the second and third highest Total Orders, respectively.



2. Correlation between Order and Sales:

We checked if there was a correlation between order and sales using a scatter plot. Our analysis revealed that there is a positive correlation between the two variables. This means that as the number of orders increases, sales also tend to increase.



3. Sales:

The Midwest had the highest Sales at $13,563,917.85, which was 34.66% higher than the West's lowest Sales at $10,072,567.44. The other regions, namely the Northeast, South, and Southwest, had sales that fell in between these two values.



4. Sales and Profit:

We observed that Sales and Profit diverged the most in the Midwest region. In this region, Sales were $9,688,512.76 higher than Profit. This suggests that while the company is generating high sales in the Midwest region, it may be facing challenges in converting these sales into profits.
